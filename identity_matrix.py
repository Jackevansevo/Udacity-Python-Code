# Given a list of lists representing a n * n matrix as input, 
# define a  procedure that returns True if the input is an identity matrix 
# and False otherwise.

# An IDENTITY matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements 
# on the principal/main diagonal are 1 and all the elements outside 
# the principal diagonal are 0. 
# (A square matrix is a matrix in which the number of rows 
# is equal to the number of columns)

def is_identity_matrix(matrix):
  l = len(matrix)
  x = 0
  for e in matrix:
    while x < l:
      print matrix[0][x]
      x = x + 1





# Test Cases:

matrix1 = [[1,0,0,0],
           [0,1,0,0],
           [0,0,1,0],
           [0,0,0,1]]
print is_identity_matrix(matrix1)
#>>>True
